Not only because of its magical nature, but also because it is made out of a crystalline material known as voidstone. Voidstone is used by warlocks to trap souls and essences of greater demons. It is said that its wielder can commune with the demons trapped inside and through sheer will, they can be coerced to reveal their knowledge and secrets.<BR/><BR/>No mere smith can forge this weapon, in fact, it took the great Arcane Blacksmith Isabelle Dawson three days and three nights to forge in the blistering forges of Ironforge. <BR/><BR/></P></BODY></HTML>",

At the time, practicing such dark arts was tantamount to treason, and therefore, Avitus wrote his knowledge and secrets in glyphs which could only be read by those chosen by it. <BR/><BR/>The Silver Hand caught wind of his craft and soon mounted a party to take him in, however, once the paladins arrived at his hovel in the Swamp of Sorrows, they found the warlock dead, holding the book. It is said that Avitus, knowing that his end was creeping closer, sacrificed himself and bound his soul to the book. A senior paladin was tasked with the keeping of the book, but while crossing Deadwind Pass, his party was assaulted by Ogres and the book was lost.<BR/><BR/><BR/></P></BODY></HTML>",

As a token of gratitude, the Prophet had the bough shaped into a staff and with the help of the Naaru, he infused it with Holy powers in order to aid its wielder to deliver care and kindness to a world that knows only war.

No less than twenty people have claimed ownership of the amulet, but what is intrigueing is the fact that the alleged owners were from all over Azeroth, and they've been recorded since the times of the Arathorian Empire.<BR/><BR/>One thing is certain, that those who wear the pendant have their senses heightened and are able to percieve more than the average mortal would.<BR/><BR/></P></BODY></HTML>",

He swung his pick at it and from its ore he forged a blade as dark and black as night itself. It reflected no light back from it's metallic blade and the smith fashioned an ornate enrgaved path which blood of the fallen foes could flow through the blade, to serve as a testament to its wielder's conquests.<BR/><BR/>He named it &quot;Mor'Rakka&quot;, Black Claw in his tongue, for its ability to cleave through armor seemed to make any soldier fight like a seasoned veteran. <BR/><BR/></P></BODY></HTML>",

During the Second War, a pair of Twin Assassins known only by their nicknames Dementia and Dirge were notorious and highly sought after by both sides of the war in order to secure their service, or otherwise dispose of it.<BR/><BR/>Dementia was known to poison her foes and leave them weak, debilitated and confused,  while Dirge delivired a single slash to the stunned foe's throat, regardless of the armor he was wearing. <BR/><BR/>The twins wreaked havoc on either side, until they were finally caught by the Doomhammer's Orcish armies and used by Gul'dan to make the first Deathknights along Teron Gorefiend. The twins became nothing more than lifeless shells hosting an orcish soul for Gul'dan's twisted plans were slain by Gavinrad the Dire himself.<BR/><BR/>The daggers used by the twins are all that remain of their legacy, last seen in a display case in the palace of Tradeprince Gallywix.<BR/><BR/></P></BODY></HTML>",

They united the tribes and became a kingdom with King Thoradin holding the most prominence as the ruler who aided the Elves and brought the gift of Magic to his people.<BR/><BR/>It was a time of great academic advancements and foremost in his field was the Prime-Apothecary Thelilopheles Thalipydios, healer of the sick, carer of the wounded. His fame tripled when he saved his king from certain death after King Thoradin was afflicted with a malaise from a festering wound.<BR/><BR/>With the sole exception of Thoradin's Wall in Arathi, the Almanac of Thelilopheles is one of the very few relics remaining from the times of Arathor. It was written by Machaon, son of Thelilopheles, who recounted his father's deeds and recorded his cures.

She wielded a spear in the defense of her people from horrors unimaginable. She danced through the battlefield, slaying foes with grace and fierceness alike, leaving only a swath of fallen enemies, like wheat after a harvest.<BR/><BR/>However, Celestia was not unkind, nor was she lustful for battle. Her nature was cheerful and merciful, and she always offered her foe a chance to retreat. She stood for all that was good and worth protecting; her family, her friends and her people. When the Queen herself turned against her people and brought the Burning Legion to Azeroth, Celestia fought against the demons, often saving refugees from a horrible fate.<BR/><BR/>After the Well of Eternity imploded, Celestia journeyed to the top of Mount Hyjal, to see what remained of the land. A vast ocean, as far as the horizon, a whole continent, cleft in twain. Celestia's heart was broken at what her people had wrought through malice, greed and war. She vowed to never again lift her spear, Ascalon, for battle, and she threw it with all her might into the distant ocean, lost forever.<BR/><BR/></P></BODY></HTML>",
